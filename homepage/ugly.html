                        While I don't have much in terms of professional work, I do have a few highlights:

                    <p>
                        I have worked for many years, helping the artist known as Ahhgela. She is a Toronto based artist who sells
                        her artwork at many anime/comic convetions and car shows. I help her run booths when she is unable to appear.
                        Some of my tasks:
                    </p>
                    <div className = "list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Setting up/Taking down booths and displays and organizing merchandising</li>
                            <li>Processing transactions and interacting with customers</li>
                            <li>General stock and inventory check</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                     <p>
                        It is a really fun job that lets me go to different conventions and get to show off my love of anime and all
                        things nerdy. I also get to meet new people each time.

                        While not a official job (CSL program done through CMPUT 401), I was able to use my skills and get
                        experience developing a real website. I mainly dealt with the frontend helping to develop many of the features involving
                        participants and help design the UI. I also focused on building many of the tests for the frontend (and the backend) and also help
                        keep up with the important documents and makefile website for the class.
