        <h2>Work History</h2>
        <p>
            While I don't have much in terms of professional work, I do have a few highlights:
        </p>
        <h3>
            Convention Vendor
        </h3>
        <p>
            I have worked for many years, helping the artist known as Ahhgela. She is a Toronto based artist who sells
            her <br>
            artwork at many anime/comic convetions and car shows. I help her run booths when she is unable to appear.
            Some <br>
            of my tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting up/Taking down booths and displays and organizing merchandising</li>
            <li>Processing transactions and interacting with customers</li>
            <li>General stock and inventory check</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is a really fun job that lets me go to different conventions and get to show off my love of anime and all
            things<br>
            nerdy. I also get to meet new people each time.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Frontend developer- Safewalk
        </h3>
        <p>
            While not a official job (CSL program done through CMPUT 401), I was able to use my skills and get
            experience developing <br>
            a real website. I mainly dealt with the frontend helping to develop many of the features involving
            participants and help <br>
            design the UI. I also focused on building many of the tests for the frontend (and the backend) and also help
            keep up with </thead> <br>
            the important documents and makefile website for the class.
